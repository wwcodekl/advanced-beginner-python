    "The idea of interface is really simple - it is the **description of how an object behaves**. Do you see the benefit of interface? You'll see a lot of this in your assignments.\n",

    "**Warning**: This is for intermediate level (Do this when we have time)   \n",
    "For those of us who has knowledge in other programming language (i.e. Java, TypeScript, C#), you probably have experience with coding interface. How do you do it?\n",
