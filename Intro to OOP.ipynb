    "# Object Oriented Programming\n",
    "\n",
    "Python are multi-paradigm; you can write programs or libraries that are largely procedural (what we have seen so far), object-oriented, or functional. Examples of OOP languages are Java and C#. \n",
    "\n",
    "## History\n",
    "1966 - **Alan Kay** pioneers the OOP works. He was largely inspired by Skecthpad (MIT project created by Ivan Sutherland in 1960â€“61)   \n",
    "1960s - Simula language  \n",
    "1970s - Smalltalk language developed at Xerox PARC by Alan Kay, Dan Ingalls and Adele Goldberg  \n",
    "1970s - Influenced Lisp  \n",
    "1980s - Objective-C, C++   \n",
    "1990s and later - Python (1991), Java (1991), C# (1999), VB.Net (2002)  \n",
    "\n",
    "What's the original idea of OOP? \n",
    "1. Message Passing - A method call is message passing.  It is conceptualized as a message (the name of the method and its input parameters) being passed to the object for dispatch.\n",
    "2. Encapsulation - binds together the data and functions that manipulate the data, and that keeps both safe from outside interference and misuse\n",
    "\n",
    "Or in **Alan Kay's** own words  \n",
    "> \"... how to organize things so that interesting worthwhile models are both easy to build, and help make complex things more understandable. Simple things should be simple, complex things should be possible.\"\n",

    "### Method vs Function\n",
    "A `class` is simply a logical grouping of data and functions (the latter of which are frequently referred to as **methods** when defined within a class).\n",
    "\n",
    "What do we mean by \"logical grouping\"? Well, a class can contain any data we'd like it to, and can have any functions (methods) attached to it that we please. Rather than just throwing random things together under the name \"class\", we try to create classes where there is a logical connection between things. \n",

    "\n",
    "Classes can be thought of as blueprints for creating objects. When I define a Customer class using the class keyword, I haven't actually created a customer. Instead, what I've created is a sort of instruction manual for constructing \"customer\" objects. \n",
