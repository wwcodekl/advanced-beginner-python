    "## Object Oriented Programming - Part 2\n",

    "### Composition\n",
    "\n",
    "Objects can be composed from other objects - relationship ...  \n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class Cookie(object):\n",
    "    def __init__(self, scarf):\n",
    "        self.scarf = scarf\n",
    "\n",
    "class Scarf(object):\n",
    "    def __init__(self, color):\n",
    "        self.color = color\n",
    "\n",
    "green_scarf = Scarf(color='green')\n",
    "c1 = Cookie(scarf=green_scarf)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Can we reference more than one object ? \n",
    "\n",
    "### Inheritance\n",
    "\n",
    "Why do we need to inherit codes? Look at the codes below, what did you notice?\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class Employee(object):\n",
    "    def __init__(self, first_name, last_name):\n",
    "        self.first_name = first_name\n",
    "        self.last_name = last_name\n",
    "        \n",
    "    def full_name(self):\n",
    "        return \"{} {}\".format(\n",
    "            self.first_name, self.last_name)\n",
    "            \n",
    "class Customer(object):\n",
    "    def __init__(self, first_name, last_name):\n",
    "        self.first_name = first_name\n",
    "        self.last_name = last_name\n",
    "        \n",
    "    def full_name(self):\n",
    "        return \"{} {}\".format(\n",
    "            self.first_name, self.last_name)\n",
    "```\n",

    "Inheritance to the rescue - https://repl.it/KTZf/1 \n",
    "\n",
    "Sometimes it is called **subclassing**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note**: If we have time, we'll revisit Class method - how to code to anticipate subclassing ...\n",
    "\n",
    "### Multiple Inheritance\n",
    "\n",
    "If we were to draw the relationships between `Employee`, `Customer` and `Person` classes above, how will it look like?\n",
    "\n",
    "How about example codes below?  \n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class Vehicle(object):\n",
    "    def __init__(self, name, wheel):\n",
    "        self.name = name\n",
    "        self.wheel = wheel\n",
    "\n",
    "    def move(self):\n",
    "        print(\"I can't move\")\n",
    "\n",
    "class GroundVehicle(Vehicle):\n",
    "    def move(self):\n",
    "        print(\"I'm moving through the ground\")\n",
    "\n",
    "class FlyingVehicle(Vehicle):\n",
    "\n",
    "    def __init__(self, name, wheel, wings):\n",
    "        Vehicle.__init__(self, name, wheel) # super().__init__(name, wheel)\n",
    "        self.wings = wings\n",
    "        \n",
    "    def move(self):\n",
    "        print(\"I'm moving through the air\")\n",
    "\n",
    "class Airplane(FlyingVehicle, GroundVehicle):\n",
    "    \n",
    "    def __init__(self, name, wheel, wings, lavatory):\n",
    "        FlyingVehicle.__init__(self, name, wheel, wings) # super().__init__(name, wheel, wings)\n",
    "        self.lavatory = lavatory\n",
    "    \n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Food for thought**: \n",
    "1. Should we use super() or the ? Why?\n",
    "2. Which move() method will Airplane inherit? \n",
    "3. If the main point of inheritance is for code reuse, then how do we decide which class is inherits from which?  \n",
    "\n",
    "### Polymorphism\n",
    "\n",
    "It means \"the ability to appear in many forms\". So, what you saw in the code sample above is one example of polymorphism - `move` method in various forms.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Can you think of another example? **Hint**: It's a math operation ... \n",
    "\n",
    "### Which programming paradigm is better?\n",
    "\n",
    "What do you think is considered as good design? \n",
    "\n",
